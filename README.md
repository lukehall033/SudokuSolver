# SudokuSolver
Simple playable sudoku program developed with PyGame that utilizes a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve. Any incomplete board can be input, and the user can enter numbers until they place 3 wrong digits. If 3 wrong digits are input the backtracking solver is run which solves the board. 

# What I Learned
* Basic/intermediate PyGame functionality
* Implementing recursive backtracking algorithms
* Game theory and development

# Usage
Both Game.py and SudokuSolver.py are needed to run the game. The starting board can be input into the Game file. The user can enter numbers anywhere on the board according to normal sudoku rules until the board is finished or 3 mistakes are made. Once the mistakes are made the board will solve itself. Upon completion of the board, the spacebar can be pressed to check the board for correctness. SudokuSolver.py can also double as a text-based version of this, where an incomplete board can be input and the solved board will be output upon slight modification to the code.
